*** This repo contains all my assignment work while going through Software Design and Architecture Specialization in Coursera.


The Graduation Project includes a Java-based Android application that will be evaluated and developed over the four courses of the Specialization. This application will transform from a single user application that stores data locally to a multi-user application that stores data remotely. A Java codebase is provided as a starting point for each course, and it is necessary to document and implement new features using the knowledge gained in the course.
